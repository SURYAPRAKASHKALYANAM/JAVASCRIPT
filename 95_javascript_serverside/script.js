/* JavaScript is the server-side language used to develop services for the Opera Unite feature of the Opera browser. 
This is a server built into the browser. 
The JavaScript API includes local file access to a virtual sandboxed file-system and persistent storage via persistent global variables. 
Node.js is a runtime environment to allow JavaScript to not only be run in the browser, 
but also on the server (or almost any environment, really). 
That also expanded the types of applications that could be built with the language since it wasn't tied to only the client-side anymore.
After that, the popularity of the language exploded.
Node is available on Windows, Linux, Mac, and many other platforms.
Developers started using the power of the platform, which allowed them to access APIs such as the filesystem and to use powerful applications.
Popular projects have been created to ease the development of software, web, desktop, mobile, and other types of applications. 
Thanks to Node, Chromium, and Electron we can now have sophisticated IDEs like 
Visual Studio Code, programming languages like TypeScript, powerful command-line applications like React Native, and Expo to 
create mobile apps with React.This is all possible because JavaScript is now available everywhere.*/
